# react-vs-angular-vs-vanillaJS

Calculator made with react.js, Angular and vanilla JS

See the deployed version: https://zealous-poitras-40ef7d.netlify.app/

I wanted to compare working with Angular and React.js by creating a simple project with both technologies. Lastly, I added the version in vanilla JS. The calculator is based on the simple Iphone calculator, with a couple of changes in style.
